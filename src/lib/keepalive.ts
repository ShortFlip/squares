/**
 * Supabase keepalive ping, run by the Worker's daily Cron Trigger
 * (`custom-worker.ts`).
 *
 * Why it exists: a free-tier Supabase project auto-pauses after about a week
 * with no API traffic, and a paused project means no game night.
 * `.github/workflows/keepalive.yml` pings twice a week, but GitHub switches
 * scheduled workflows off after 60 days without repo activity — exactly the
 * quiet stretch in which the project would also go to sleep. The Cron Trigger
 * is the second, independent pinger that doesn't depend on commits.
 *
 * Deliberately pure: no Next.js, no Supabase client and no `@/` path alias.
 * It is bundled straight into the Worker entry by wrangler, outside the Next
 * build, and the fetch function is injected so vitest can drive it without a
 * network.
