/**
 * Read every player's row for a round out of the database and push it into
 * the store: other players' boards into `others`, and every winner (ourselves
 * included) into `winners`.
 *
 * Other players' marks arrive live over `mark_updated` broadcasts, but a
 * broadcast is fire-and-forget: a client that joined late, refreshed, or lost
 * the socket never saw the earlier ones. DESIGN.md treats "their miniature
 * shows 0/25 after a refresh" as an unacceptable failure, so the DB — which
 * every client writes its own marks to on a 500 ms debounce — is the recovery
 * source. The same goes for `bingo_confirmed`: a missed bingo announcement is
 * not tolerated either, so the won rows are replayed as winners here.
 * Called on mount, after the local upsert that follows `game_started`, and
 * every time the channel regains SUBSCRIBED.
 *
 * `includeMyCard` also replaces my own card with my row's card_data. Only the
 * mid-round game swap rewrites a card after the round starts, so only its
 * broadcast and the reconnect replay (which may have missed that broadcast)
 * ask for it; every other caller already built my card from the same row.
 * Marks are untouched: they are grid indexes and the swap keeps positions.
 *
 * Returns false when the read failed, so a caller that must not act on a
 * partial picture (the rejoin path, before it restores marks) can retry.
