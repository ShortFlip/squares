 *
 * Why it exists: the empty-item filter, the settings parse and the call-list
 * generation used to be copy-pasted in three places. If the filter drifts in
 * one of them, item indices stop lining up between the card and the call list
 * and players see the wrong squares light up.
 *
 * @param seed - Pass the existing game's seed when rebuilding state for a game
 *   that already exists (reconnect); omit to mint a new one for a new round.
