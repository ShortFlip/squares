# CLAUDE.md — Squares

> A real-time multiplayer bingo platform for small friend groups.

**Squares** is a web-hosted, real-time multiplayer bingo app. A host creates a custom bingo card template, starts a game room, and friends join via a short room code. The host calls items from a caller panel, players mark squares on their synced boards, and the system detects/verifies wins. Game history, leaderboards, and stats persist across sessions — no account required (but optionally supported).

**Target audience:** 3-5 friends playing recurring bingo nights.

**Before writing or changing any interface code — read `DESIGN.md`.**
If a request conflicts with DESIGN.md, say so before building.
Part 2 is intentionally incomplete. Do not fill the gap with framework
defaults; follow its guardrails and ask.

## Design Direction

### Aesthetic: "Arcade Lounge"
Think neon-lit bowling alley meets modern game night — playful but polished. NOT corporate SaaS, NOT kiddy/classroom.

### Design Tokens
- **Background:** Deep charcoal (`#0f0f14`) with subtle noise texture
- **Surface:** Slightly lighter (`#1a1a24`) for cards, panels, modals
- **Primary accent:** Electric violet (`#7c3aed`) — used sparingly for CTAs, active states, winner effects
- **Secondary accent:** Warm amber (`#f59e0b`) — marked squares, highlights
- **Success:** Emerald (`#10b981`) — bingo confirmation, win states
- **Danger:** Rose (`#f43f5e`) — errors, destructive actions
- **Text primary:** `#f1f5f9`
- **Text secondary:** `#94a3b8`
- **Grid lines:** `#2d2d3a` default, customizable per card template

### Typography
- **Display/Headers:** A bold, characterful font (e.g., Outfit, Clash Display, or Satoshi) — NOT Inter, NOT Roboto
- **Body/UI:** A clean geometric sans (e.g., General Sans, Plus Jakarta Sans)
- **Monospace (codes/stats):** JetBrains Mono

### Key Visual Elements
- Squares glow subtly when marked (box-shadow pulse)
- Winner gets a confetti cannon animation + board highlight
- Caller panel has a "now calling" card flip animation
- Room code displayed large and bold — easy to read aloud over a call
- Dark mode is default; light mode supported

### Component Patterns
- Use shadcn/ui as the base — customize colors/radius to match tokens
- Border radius: `rounded-lg` (8px) for cards, `rounded-md` (6px) for buttons
- Consistent 4px spacing scale (Tailwind default)
- All interactive elements need hover, active, focus, and disabled states
- Transitions: 150ms ease for micro-interactions, 300ms for panel/modal transitions

## Architecture

### Data Flow
```
Browser (Player) ←→ Supabase Realtime Channel ←→ Browser (Host)
                          ↕
                    Supabase PostgreSQL
```

No server code runs in the game loop. Win verification is **client-side**: the
claimant's own tab detects the pattern, claims it, and the claim is broadcast to
everyone. There is no Edge Function and no server authority over the result.
That is a deliberate call for a three-friend honor-system game — see "Next Up".

### Real-time Game Sync
Each game room subscribes to a Supabase Realtime channel: `room:{roomCode}`.
Broadcasts are sent from `RoomClient.tsx` and received in `useRealtimeRoom`:
`game_started`, `item_called`, `mark_updated`, `bingo_confirmed` (sent by the
winner's own tab), `room_closed`. Join/leave is Presence `sync`. A
`postgres_changes` subscription on `rooms` and `games` replays a missed broadcast.
The other names in `types/game.ts` (`square_marked`, `bingo_claimed`,
`round_reset`, `player_joined`/`player_left`) are never sent.

**Authority model:** Host is the source of truth for game progression. Only the host can call items and reset rounds.

### Identity, cards, wins
- Identity is a `localStorage` `browserId` plus a Supabase anonymous session; a
  new PC re-points at an existing player with `players.claim_code`.
- **Seed-based RNG:** Use a seeded PRNG (e.g., `mulberry32`) so each player's card is reproducible from `(templateId, gameSeed, playerId)`. Every round draws N² items from the template's pool (Fisher-Yates, or column-locked); the card is also stored in `game_players.card_data`.

### Win Detection
Runs in the browser on every mark (`src/lib/game/win-detection.ts`). Checks the
player's marks against each enabled pattern:
- **Row / Column / Diagonal / Four Corners / Blackout**; `custom` is typed but
  matches nothing yet (`matchesPattern` returns false)
- `bestLine()` returns the closest incomplete line, which drives the "one away"
  label, the hot lane on my board, and every rail miniature's status

A detected win auto-claims — there is no BINGO button. The round keeps running
so second place can still happen.

The schema is `supabase/migrations/` plus the generated `src/lib/supabase/types.ts`.

Styling is Tailwind v4 — the theme lives in `globals.css` (`@theme inline`), so
there is no `tailwind.config.ts`. The `game_nights` table exists in the schema
but is unused: a **night is a room**, and `/history` groups by room.

---

## Code Conventions

### General
- **TypeScript strict mode** — no `any` unless absolutely unavoidable (and comment why)
- **Functional components only** — no class components
- **Named exports** — no default exports except for Next.js pages/layouts
- **Barrel exports** — `index.ts` in each component directory (not followed yet: no `index.ts` exists under `src/components/` — ask before adding or dropping)
- **Comments** — explain the "why", not the "what". Add comments for non-obvious logic, game rules, and algorithm choices

### File Naming
- Components: `PascalCase.tsx`
- Utilities/hooks/stores: `camelCase.ts`
- Types: `camelCase.ts` (colocated with feature or in `types/`)

### Component Pattern
`'use client'` when interactive, a named export with a typed `Props` interface, classes merged with `cn()` from `@/lib/utils` (worked example in the decision index).

### State Management
- **Zustand stores** for game state, editor state, player identity
- **React state** for component-local UI state (modals, inputs, hover)
- **Supabase Realtime** for cross-client sync — events update Zustand stores
- Never put Supabase Realtime subscriptions in components directly — always go through `useRealtimeRoom` hook

### Supabase Patterns
- Use `@supabase/ssr` for server-side operations
- Browser client: `createBrowserClient()` in `lib/supabase/client.ts`
- Server client: `createServerClient()` in `lib/supabase/server.ts`
- Always handle Supabase errors explicitly — never swallow them
- Use generated types from `supabase gen types typescript`

### Error Handling
- Wrap all Supabase calls in try/catch
- Show user-facing errors via toast (shadcn/ui toast or sonner)
- Log errors to console in development
- Never expose raw database errors to users

## Environment Variables

```env
# .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-key  # Server-side only, never expose
```

Running locally, type check, lint and migrations: `README.md`.

---

## Deployment

Push to `master` and `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` runs `npm run cf:deploy`
(OpenNext build → `wrangler deploy`) onto **Cloudflare Workers**. The
`NEXT_PUBLIC_*` Supabase values are repo secrets, baked in at build time. There
is no Docker image and nothing runs on Sanctuary — the plan to self-host behind
a Cloudflare tunnel was dropped in favour of Workers.

---

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit tests (in place):** `npm test` runs Vitest over card generation and
  shuffling, win detection and `bestLine`, the call list, and the import parser.
- **Live gates (in place, not in CI):** each phase is proved against two real
  browser contexts via `.playwright-mcp/pw.cjs` (a CDP driver) pointed at the dev
  server, printing `GATE <name>: PASS/FAIL` lines.
- **Not done:** component tests, and a scripted end-to-end run in CI.

---

## Notes

- The name "Squares" is a working title and may change. It's only referenced in `package.json` `name` field, the root layout `<title>`, and any logo/branding components.
- This is a personal project for 3-5 friends. No need for rate limiting, abuse prevention, or enterprise features in MVP.
- Sound effects and confetti are non-negotiable. They make the game.
- **Desktop only.** Squares lives on a second monitor beside Discord while the
  main monitor is playing something else. Assume ~1280×800 minimum. No mobile work.

---

## Decisions

Read the file before changing the code it names. Each keeps the original text verbatim.

- Stay on Next.js + Supabase Realtime + Zustand + shadcn/ui — no custom socket server, no Redux; versions come from `package.json` — docs/decisions/0001-stack-choices.md
- A win is whatever the claimant's tab detects; no Edge Function, RLS open, and that must change before outsiders join — docs/decisions/0002-client-side-win-verification.md
- Identity is `browserId` + anonymous session + `claim_code`; there is no account, login or merge path — docs/decisions/0003-identity-without-login.md
- Cards stay seed-reproducible but `card_data` is what the app reads; `custom` win patterns are unimplemented — docs/decisions/0004-seeded-cards-and-win-patterns.md
- The migrations and `types.ts` are the schema, not the planned table list; RLS is open, `game_nights` unused — docs/decisions/0005-database-schema-as-planned.md
- The Phase 1–5 plan is history: where it disagrees with the code, the code wins; ask before building a plan item — docs/decisions/0006-original-phase-plan.md
- Import `cn` from `@/lib/utils`, never `@/lib/utils/cn` (the old example's path does not exist) — docs/decisions/0007-component-pattern-example.md

## Version history

| PR | Shipped | What landed |
|---|---|---|
| #7 | 2026-09-08 | Rejoin + connection truth. Vitest; `useRealtimeRoom` handles every channel status with resubscribe backoff and a `connection` state; everyone's cards and marks load from `game_players` into an `others` store slice; landing Rejoin chip. |
| #8 | 2026-09-08 | The Scoreboard game screen. Glass header with the room code and Copy link, a 608px hero board with the hot lane, a 300px rail of live miniatures, `bestLine`/`bestLineLabel`, the amber reconnecting bar, the SYNCING rail state, `--gold` in every theme, and the DEV-only `?state=` harness. |
| #9 | 2026-09-08 | The bingo moment. `WinOverlay` retired for an in-flow gold `WinBanner`; the hero grid shrinks 608→520 and stays markable; per-winner fanfare and two-cannon confetti; gold rail cards with `1ST`/`2ND` pills and a gold winning line. |
| #10 | 2026-09-08 | The item pool. A template holds more items than squares, so every round draws a fresh subset per player; `parseImport` splits newlines then commas and dedupes; count line and Save gate replace the old filled-squares widget. |
| #11 | 2026-09-08 | Identity and aftermath. `players.claim_code` re-points a new PC at an existing player; `/history` groups rounds into nights with cancelled rounds shown as `No winner`; `/leaderboard` scoped to co-players with cancelled rounds excluded. |
| #12 (this PR) | 2026-09-08 | Host controls and docs. `HostControls` moves into the game header so a round nobody wins is no longer a dead end; End Night cancels a winnerless final round so it never reaches the leaderboard; `isConnected` and other dead exports removed; CLAUDE.md and DESIGN.md brought back to reality. |

## Next Up

Known gaps, deliberate or otherwise. None of these block a game night.

- **Reconnect backoff has never met a real dropped socket.** The
  `CHANNEL_ERROR`/`TIMED_OUT`/`CLOSED` path and its 1–2–4–8s backoff were
  exercised only through the `?state=reconnecting` harness.
- **RLS is wide open and win verification is client-side.** Insert and update
  are `true` for every game table, and a win is whatever the claimant's browser
  says it is. Deliberate — three friends on a voice call, no adversary. It is
  also the one thing that must change before anyone else is invited in.
- **Traditional caller mode was restyled, not redesigned.** `CallerPanel` and
  `CalledItems` were dropped into rail glass cards and left alone. Honor-system
  play is the real mode.
- **The light theme's glass inversion has never been reviewed on a real game
  screen.** Latte was checked on the landing page only; the header, banner and
  rail all assume white-on-dark translucency.
